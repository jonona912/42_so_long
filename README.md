## üí° About the project

> _so_long is an individual 42 school project focused on creating a minimalistic 2D game using C and the MiniLibX graphical library. The goal is to build a simple game engine that handles map parsing, player movement, collectibles, and basic graphical rendering. This project serves as an introduction to event-driven programming, graphics handling, and resource management in C._

For more detailed information, see the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/jonona912/42_so_long/blob/main/so_long_subject.pdf).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

- **gcc** compiler
- **MiniLibX** graphical library

### Instructions

**1. Cloning and compiling the project**

Clone the repository and compile:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Running the game**

Run the executable with a map file as an argument:

```shell
$ ./so_long maps/example.ber
```

## üìö What I Learned

- Enhanced my coding skills, especially developing a vision for code structure before even writing it
- Using structs and enums
- Basics of graphical programming with MiniLibX
- Event-driven programming and handling user input
- Map parsing and validation
- Implementing simple game logic in C
- Improved debugging and resource management skills
- Improved at handling memory leaks
