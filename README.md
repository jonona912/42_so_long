So Long - Project at 42 school (42 Wolfsburg)

The project was interesting in terms of using the MiniLibx library (a simple X-Window (X11R6) programming API in C) and improving my coding skill. I became more comfortable in using structs and enums. I also improved handling memory leaks. As usual, I wrote some code and then saw what I needed to do better for better code, then rewrote code and made a lot of changes. This has my coding skills, especially developing a vision of how a code looks like before even writing it.
